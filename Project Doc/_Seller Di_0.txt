Initial   Outreach   (Day   1)  
Text   1   –   Opener:  
Hey   [Name],   I   saw   you   might   be   the   owner   of   [Property   Address]   —   would   you   be  
open   to   a   no-obligation   cash   offer   for   the   property?  
Text   2   –   Follow-Up   if   No   Reply   (after   a   few   hours):  
We   buy   homes   as-is   and   can   close   on   your   timeline.   Just   wanted   to   see   if   that’s  
something   you’d   consider?

Great!   I   just   need   a   few   quick   details   to   see   if   it’s   a   fit.  
Is   the   property   currently   vacant,   rented,   or   owner-occupied?

Just   checking   in   —   if   you’re   at   all   curious   what   a   cash   offer   might   look   like   for  
[Property   Address],   I’d   be   happy   to   get   that   started.   Totally   no   pressure.  
Text   7   –   Final   Follow-Up   (Day   4):  
Still   open   to   selling   [Property   Address]?   We   make   fair   cash   offers   and   cover   closing  
costs.   Let   me   know   if   you'd   like   to   chat   or   want   the   offer   sent   over.  

If   They   Say   “What’s   the   Offer?”   or   “How   Much?”

ideally   a   quick   walkthrough.
