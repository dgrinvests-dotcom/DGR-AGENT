2)   Follow-Up   on   Seller’s   Requested   Date  
Day   Of   Reminder  
“Hi   {FirstName},   just   following   up   like   you   asked   about   your   property   at   {Address}.   Derek   is   still  
interested   and   ready   to   chat   whenever   works   best.   Would   you   like   to   schedule   a   quick   call   this  
week?   {Calendly}.”  
 
If   No   Reply   (3–4   days   later)  
“Hey   {FirstName},   circling   back   on   our   follow-up.   No   pressure   at   all—just   making   sure   I   reach  
you   at   a   good   time.   Should   I   hold   a   spot   on   Derek’s   calendar,   or   check   back   another   time?”  
 
Polite   Close-Out   (7   days   after   follow-up   date)  
“Hi   {FirstName},   I’ll   close   my   file   for   now   unless   you’d   like   to   revisit   selling   {Address}.   If  
circumstances   change,   Derek   would   be   glad   to   reconnect   and   make   a   cash   offer.”  
 
Tone   &   Agent   Rules  
●   Always   acknowledge   the   missed   call   or   prior   request   →   builds   trust.  
 
●   Offer   flexibility   (“afternoon   or   evening”)   instead   of   just   dropping   the   Calendly   link.  
 
●   Stop   after   3   touches   unless   the   seller   re-engages   →   avoids   feeling   pushy.  
 
●   Mark   CRM   with   a   “Next   Contact   Date”   if   they   still   say   “check   back   later.”
