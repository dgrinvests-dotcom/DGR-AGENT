Vacant   Land   AI   Agent   Dialogue   Flow  
Step   1:   First   Contact   (SMS/Email   opener)  
“Hi   {FirstName},   this   is   Derek.   I’m   buying   vacant   land   in   {County}   and   noticed   you   own   a  
parcel   near   {NearestTown}.   Would   you   consider   a   cash   offer   if   it   was   simple   and   hassle-free?  
  (If   not   interested,   just   let   me   know.   Reply   STOP   to   opt   out.)”  
 
Step   2:   If   they   say   Yes   /   Maybe   /   What’s   your   offer?  
Agent:  
  “Great!   To   put   something   together   that   makes   sense,   could   I   ask   a   few   quick   questions   about  
the   property?   Won’t   take   long.”  
 
Step   3:   Qualifying   Questions   (one   at   a   time,   short   messages)  
1.   “Do   you   know   roughly   how   many   acres   or   lot   size   your   parcel   is?”  
 
2.   “Does   it   have   road   access ,   or   is   it   landlocked?”  
 
3.   “Any   idea   if   utilities   (water,   power,   septic/sewer)   are   nearby?”  
 
4.   “Are   there   any   back   taxes,   liens,   or   HOA   fees   tied   to   the   land?”  
 
5.   “If   we   agreed   on   a   fair   cash   price,   what’s   the   ballpark   amount   you’d   want?”  
 
(AI   agent   pauses   after   each   question,   waits   for   response,   then   continues.   If   seller   is   unsure,  
agent   can   say   “No   worries,   we   can   still   move   forward.”)  
 
Step   4:   Transition   to   Appointment  
If   answers   show   they’re   open   to   sell   →  

“Perfect,   thanks   for   sharing   that.   The   next   step   is   super   simple:   we’ll   do   a   quick   15-minute   call  
where   Derek   can   review   your   land   details   and   give   you   a   cash   range.   What’s   easier   for  
you— afternoon   or   evening   this   week ?”  
(AI   agent   either   offers   times   or   sends   Calendly   link   immediately.)  
 
Step   5:   Booking   &   Confirmation  
Once   they   pick   a   time   →  
“Got   it!   I’ve   booked   you   for   {Date/Time}.   You’ll   get   a   confirmation   from   our   calendar.   If   anything  
changes,   just   reply   here   and   we’ll   reschedule.   Looking   forward   to   it!”  
 
Step   6:   If   they   say   Not   Interested  
“No   problem   at   all,   I   appreciate   the   reply.   If   you   ever   reconsider   selling   your   land   in   the   future,  
feel   free   to   reach   out.”  
  (Mark   as   No-Interest,   remove   from   follow-up   sequence.)
